Luo's direct simulation Monte Carlo program
============================================
### Introduction:
This project is developed by myself as a part of my graduate thesis. The program is used to simulate two dimensional flow, especially rarefied gas flow by DSMC method. The code is developed from G.A. Bird's DS2 but I have rewrite most of the code in order to make it compatible to unstructured mesh generated by commercial software like Gridgen. 

Anyone who is interested in the project could contact me by E-mail. My E-mail is han.luo@gmail.com. You can also visit my blog at http://luohan.phpapps.jp.

Thanks to G.A. Bird for his program code and Yazhong Jiang for his kind help during the development.
